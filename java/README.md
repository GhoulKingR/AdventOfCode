# Day 1 - 8
At first I wanted to write the entire of AoC in Java, but I changed my mind (mainly because coding in Java is somewhat boring). Plus, my setup is built to work better with systems languages because I code a lot of Rust, C, and C++.

## How to Run
Follow these steps to run any of the days in this folder:
1. `cd` into the *java* folder and run this command to compile:
```bash
javac *.java
```

2. Run `java Main` followed by the day and part that you want to run with the `--day` and `--part` flags respectively. For example:
```bash
java Main --day 1 --part 1
```
